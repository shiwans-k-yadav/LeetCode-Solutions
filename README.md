LeetCode Solutions 🧩

This repository contains my LeetCode problem solutions, solved while practicing Data Structures & Algorithms.

I’m solving problems topic-wise to build strong fundamentals, improve logical thinking, and prepare for coding interviews.

This repo is mainly for:

revision

tracking my consistency

and understanding my own thought process later
